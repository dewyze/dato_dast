- Add logic so blocks can share tag, wrappers, css, meta methods
- Add logic for item links that may not have a top level url, they should just

- Allow a lambda for building a tag/render
- Use middleman syntax for code
  - Use language in code
- Better API for helper
  - Take an optional config for that instance only?
